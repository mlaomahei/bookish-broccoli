# bookish-broccoli

Practice repo for learning git branch workflows.

## Workflow being practiced
1. `git fetch origin` — download latest from remote
2. `git log origin/feature/broccoli-v2 --oneline` — preview incoming commits
3. `git merge origin/feature/broccoli-v2` — apply those changes onto your branch
